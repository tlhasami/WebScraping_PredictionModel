# WebScraping_PredictionModel ✅

**Overview**

This repository contains two data science projects demonstrating web-scraping, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model building.

- **House price prediction** (HousePrediction): data scraped from Zameen.com and a model that predicts house prices from features like area, location, number of rooms, and bathrooms.
- **PUBG player statistics** (Models/PubPlayerStatistics): exploratory and statistical analysis of PUBG player behavior and performance.

## Tech stack 🧰

- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter / JupyterLab
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- (optional) jupyter-contrib-nbextensions

---

## Datasets 📂

- `HousePrediction/data.csv` — scraped housing listings (features include area, location, rooms, bathrooms, price).
- PUBG dataset used inside `Models/PubPlayerStatistics/PubgPlayerBehaviour.ipynb` (not included as a top-level CSV here).

> Note: If any datasets are sensitive or large they may be stored elsewhere; check the notebooks for data-loading steps.

## How to run ▶️

1. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies (example):

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyter pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

3. Launch Jupyter and open the notebooks:

```bash
jupyter lab  # or 'jupyter notebook'
```

4. Follow the steps inside each notebook. The house price notebook shows preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (e.g., gradient-based methods), and evaluation.

## Notebooks & results 📈

- `HousePrediction/priceHouseModel.ipynb` — full pipeline: cleaning, EDA, model training and evaluation, sample predictions.
- `Models/PubPlayerStatistics/PubgPlayerBehaviour.ipynb` — EDA and statistical analysis of PUBG player metrics.

Include plots and model metrics are generated by the notebooks. Add a small summary of results in the respective notebooks' final cells if needed.
